# the_odin_project
My first project from The Odin Project. Build a simple google homepage with HTML and CSS.

Some takeaways that helped me aree to use borders if you're getting stuck. Sometimes it's easier to visually see what's happening and think about what would help the situation.

I used the What the Flexbox tutorial to help understand flex box directions and details.
